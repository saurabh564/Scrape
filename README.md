# Scrape
Scrape the product name, price, and image from each page of the catalogue (itâ€™s not necessary to open each product card).
Different settings can be provided as input, so your tool should be able to recognize them and work accordingly. For the current task, you can implement only two optional settings:
    1. The first one will limit the number of pages from which we need to scrape the information (for example, `5` means that we want to scrape only products from the first 5 pages).
    2. The secod one will provide a proxy string that tool can use for scraping
